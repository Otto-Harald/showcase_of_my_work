		This is a online strategy game, that I've created. It is similar to online chess.
		Currently the project is under work. So far I have a basic demo that works
		on locally hosted network that can send data to different clients. I will
		be shortly releasing a developper vlog to better explain my current progress.
		I use flask to communicate between python and javascript and socket io library
		to communicate between clients and the server. Currently I'm trying to establish
		a two way communication between clients and server. As of now it is still a one way
		communication.
