Description:
		This is a reservation application demo. It stores reservations and
		it's details (name, phone number, time, email, etc.) and gives them
		in a readable list on the day the reservation is. It also calculates
		the times that tables are free to be seated and reserved. It is also
		stylized and only needs to be linked to a server to be used in a 
		real restaurant. More javascript code can be found in python projects.
		I have a game that uses backend with python and has a javascript/html 
		frontend.
